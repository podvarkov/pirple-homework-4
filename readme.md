## Homework Assignment #4

This is the third of several homework assignments you'll receive in this course. In order to receive your certificate of completion (at the end of this course) you must complete all the assignments and receive a passing grade.

#### How to Turn It In:

* Create a public github repo for this assignment. 

* Create a new post in the [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1282717078530848/)  and note "Homework Assignment #3" at the top.

* In that thread, discuss what you have built, and include the link to your Github repo. 

#### The Assignment (Scenario): 

It is time to build the Admin CLI for the pizza-delivery app you built in the previous assignments. Please build a CLI interface that would allow the manager of the pizza place to:

* View all the current menu items

* View all the recent orders in the system (orders placed in the last 24 hours)

* Lookup the details of a specific order by order ID

* View all the users who have signed up in the last 24 hours

* Lookup the details of a specific user by email address
This is an open-ended assignment. You can take any direction you'd like to go with it, as long as your project includes the requirements. It can include anything else you wish as well.

#### Docs

* Before start server run ./create-dirs.sh
this will create all needed directories and generate 10 random pizzas for testing.

* To start CLI as an independent process run ```node src/cli/index.js```

* If you want to use eslint, run `npm install`
